# Skill Loading Preamble — MANDATORY

You MUST load domain-relevant skills BEFORE performing any task.
This is NOT optional — skills encode critical domain knowledge.

**Exception**: Agents whose sole purpose is git operations (@commiter) or agents that explicitly state "skill loading is not required" may skip skill loading, but should still respect the multi-agent-git-safety rules.

## How to Discover Skills

Your system prompt includes an `<available_skills>` block listing every installed skill with its name and description. Use that list as your source of truth.

### Protocol

1. **Scan the available_skills list** — Read the `<available_skills>` block in your system prompt. Each skill has a `<name>` and `<description>`.

2. **Select relevant skills** — Match skills to your current task by comparing their descriptions against the language, framework, domain, and task type you are working on. Select 2-4 skills maximum.

3. **Load selected skills** — Use the `skill` tool with the exact skill name.

4. **Fallback** — If no skill in `<available_skills>` matches your task, proceed without loading any skills. Do not block task execution on skill discovery.

5. **Re-check on context shift** — If during execution the task shifts to a new domain (e.g., from implementation to testing), re-scan the available_skills list and load additional skills as needed.

### Example

```
Available skills in system prompt:
  skill-A: Go data structures and patterns
  skill-B: Rust guidelines and best practices
  skill-C: Testing patterns (Go, table-driven)
  skill-D: Specification writing and drafting

Task: "Implement a Rust sort function"
Selection: skill-B (matches Rust domain)
→ Load skill-B using `skill` tool with name "skill-B"
```

### Anti-Patterns

- **Do NOT** skip skill loading — this wastes encoded expertise
- **Do NOT** load all skills — only 2-4 contextually relevant ones
- **Do NOT** guess skill names — use exact names from available_skills
- **Do NOT** rely on memory of what skills exist — always re-scan available_skills

## Resolution Chain for Custom Rules

Before loading any skill, check for project-specific and user-specific overrides:

1. Check `.opencode/<skill-rules-file>` (project-level override)
2. Check `~/.config/opencode/<skill-rules-file>` (user-level override)
3. Use bundled default from skill directory

Resolution is first-found-wins, never merged. Empty files are treated as absent.

## Before Starting Work

- Review `prompts/plugin_awareness.md` — For available plugins
- Scan `<available_skills>` in your system prompt — For available skills
